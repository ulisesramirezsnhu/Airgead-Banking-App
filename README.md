Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  
  this app gets the amount of money the user has and how much theyll deposit monthly and will display how much interest theyll gain with monthly deposits and without the monthly deposits 



What did you do particularly well?

  i found this app to be fun to create i think i did well creating classes 



Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

  an improvement i could do is create a class that does input validation



Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

i was struggling to connect the classes with the header but i had to google it and i found some good sites like w3schools



What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

  i can re use some of these classes and functions i made


How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

  by creating comments on every code and using classes by not rewriting code
